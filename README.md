# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm JoÃ£o Thomaz Lemos, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning engineer with a passion for using data to improve people's lives and help organizations achieve their goals more efficiently. I graduated from Universidade Federal do EspÃ­rito Santo (UFES) with a degree in Electrical Engineering and a master's in Sustainable Technologies, always exploring my interest in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Business Intelligence (BI) solutions.


In this GitHub repository, you'll find my projects and contributions related to data science and analytics. I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies and techniques, so stay tuned for updates and improvements.

## About Me

- I  have a masters in the engineering field with a focus on deep learning and statistics.
- I'm  currently working as a Machine Learning engineer at [luizalabs]([https://ri.magazineluiza.com.br/show.aspx?idMateria=zrW63qZDygmEVMe9BMldXQ%3D%3D&linguagem=pt), where i build APIs for ML model serving and RAGs, help ds to take their models to prod, and also monitor them. We are GCP based (cloud). 
- I already worked with developing ML models for anomaly detection and deploying them, using the AWS cloud, managing the resources with terraform (IaC).
- I have experience working with Python and SQL programming languages.
- I have completed several online courses and certifications in data science and analytics, mostly from Courseira.
- I have worked on projects that demonstrate my ability to gather, clean, analyze, and visualize data, as well as develop machine learning models.
- I have experience working with popular data science tools, such as Docker, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Apache Spark.
- I have excellent problem-solving skills, strong attention to detail, and the ability to work independently and as part of a team.

Let's connect and collaborate on exciting data-driven projects!
